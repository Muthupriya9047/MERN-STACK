         <h2>HISTORY:</h2>
         <p>
            
            <h3><b>The history of the tea shop dates back to ancient China and Japan, where tea houses served as social and cultural centers. The first modern European tea shop was opened in London
                   in 1717 by Thomas Twining, and the tradition was further popularized in the UK during the 19th century, partly as an alternative to pubs and as a space for women to socialize freely.<br>
                

                   As commercial tea production grew, tea shops also became important local social hubs, sometimes replacing older meat shops and reflecting broader community changes.   </b></h3>
